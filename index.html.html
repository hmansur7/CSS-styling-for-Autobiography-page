            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                On May 21st, 2004, I was born in a little town in the Indian state of Gujarat. My parents, grandparents, and cousins and I all grew up together in a tiny, bustling village. 
                Under one big roof, a tiny cluster of houses were connected by corridors and gates to form our home. This meant that I would always be around my entire family throughout the day. I loved playing sports with my cousins when I was younger; 
                we did everything from soccer to cricket to practicing our track and field runs. One day my cousin brought a computer, and that was when I had my very first computer encounter. From that day onwards, I decided I was going to be a programmer. 
                Eventually, in search for a better education for me and my siblings, my parents decided that it was time to leave India to begin a fruitful life in Canada.

                <p>Currently attending Toronto Metropolitan Unviersity and persuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science.</p>

                <h2>Education Story</h2>
                <p>
                    I formally began attending an elementary public school on May 9, 2009. 
                    I had a lot of difficulties in the beginning of my academic career. 
                    I had trouble making friends because I did not speak English well. 
                    I was unable to make a lot of friends as a result of my lack of social skills. 
                    I also struggled academically since I couldn't understand what my teachers were saying to me. 
                    I eventually began to pick up on English and learned to comprehend and speak it. 
                    Nevertheless I struggled and remained a very weak student in terms of marks. 
                    I did however make lifelong friends because I became an extroverted personality after learning English.
                    I took a course called Introduction to Computer Science in high school. 
                    I was highly interested in the material from the very first class I took.  
                    particularly given my lifelong desire to become a programmer. 
                    I enrolled in Computer Science 2, which was the next course 
                    after Introduction to Computer Science. 
                    I did incredibly well in both subjects and during my final two years of high school, my academic career in terms 
                    of grades really took off. I enrolled at Toronto Metropolitan University in September 2022 with the goal of pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. 
                    I was completely unprepared for my first semester because I wasn't used to the university setting. I consequently didn't get the best grades on my tests. However, I established additional friends who I would work on significant projects with in the future. 
                    I made the decision to take things more seriously in the second semester of my first year if I wanted to succeed in becoming a programmer. As a result, I put a lot of effort into studying for my classes both during and outside of lectures. I also got to know my instructors, who did everything in their power to ensure that I learned everything I could.  I had an excellent grade point average when I finished my first year. 
                    I'm a co-op student in my second year and recently became interested in web design. I am creating this website as a result!
